Project overview

Business Case: Leveraging shark attack data to promote responsible shark tourism and support shark conservation efforts.
Problem Statement: Without a data-driven understanding of shark activity patterns and attack incidences, it is challenging to identify suitable locations for shark diving experiences.
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that it is possible to identify high shark activity areas with low incidence rates of shark attacks, thereby enabling us to strategically select locations for shark diving experiences

Data Wrangling and Cleaning
Requirements:
- Strip whitespace from column titles
- Strip whitespace and apply lowercase to all strings in the data
- Drop any columns that don’t contribute to the research
- Convert unique strings into categorical data for certain columns
- Manage empty values and data types
Tools:
- Functions
- List comprehension
- Map/Apply
- String methods
- lambda…

Major Obstacles
- To judge what data might be invalid for the analysis
- Different formats in the data
- Categorizing data when there are so many unique entries
